* # Some people only need one...here are more than you need.

Hillary Clinton- Reasons not to vote for her- All you really need is one. 

Hillary Clinton is proposing a sharp increase in the capital-gains tax rate paid by the highest earners on short-term investments, in some cases nearly doubling it, 

Because she said, "I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material."

A government intelligence watchdog found that Hillary Clinton sent at least four emails from her personal account containing classified information during her tenure as secretary of state. 

Her violations of public records rules indicate little regard for the people's right to information. Willful, flagrant disregard for public records rules.

Benghazi - what difference does it make?  
While she was telling the public Benghazi attack was in response to a video, she was communicating the real truth, it was a terrorist attack, to her family. 

Because she said...  
"We have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance."   
She wants to "end the era of mass incarceration"

and..  
"Don't let anybody tell you that it's corporations and businesses that create jobs." 

25% viewed Mrs. Clinton as "honest and straightforward," down from 38% a year ago.

Hillary Clinton's top advisor, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother and brother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. HC also allowed her to hold down 2 jobs at the same time- a State Dept job and a private sector job. 

Hillary Clinton was in favor of the negotiated nuclear deal with Iran, yet she says...  
"They will continue to be the principal state sponsor of terrorism. They will continue to destabilize governments in the region and beyond. They will continue to use their proxies like Hezbollah. And they will continue to be an existential threat to Israel."

In April, Kathleen Willey said of Hillary Clinton: "I haven't seen one single accomplishment that would give her the credentials to be president of the United States."

Hillary Clinton put part of Bergdorf Goodman on lockdown to get a $600 haircut at the swanky John Barrett Salon.

Because she really likes private jets, she has spent $28 million on private jet travel since 2008

Because she spent $2 million in initial TV ads just to introduce you to her deceased mother. 

After leaving the State Department, Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with Atlantic Media that she preferred Iran have no enrichment capacity.

In 2010, after a Tehran request, the State Department sanctioned a Pakistan-based militant group, Jundullah, for terrorist attacks against Iran. A year later, Mrs. Clinton promoted an increase of visas issued to Iranian students, another step sought by Tehran.

"By the time she left, her position was: 'I'm not an absolute firm hard 'no' on enrichment....Let's see how it unfolds and reserve judgment on whether we'd accept enrichment until a later date,' " said a Clinton campaign foreign-affairs adviser.

If she could, she would have Bill Clinton as her running mate. 

She supports and defends Planned Parenthood. 

She holds fundraisers at the home of convicted drug traffickers. 

She's in favor of gun violence prevention, but has no clue how to do this except to demonize the NRA.
